# Targeting and Testing in the IoT era with Adobe Target

##Introduction

Adobe Target allows you several ways to create activities, manage their targeting and deliver content seamlessly. This Lab session walks you through a series of scenarios that each marketer comes across as they try to deliver the same experience across several channels.

Our goal in this lab is to build a cross device experience targeted activity for a Travel Business. We have an existing website which we will use to deliver a web based experience to. We will then target visitors to the same website from a mobile web browser differently. Lastly, we will also create a native mobile application and target a experience to it from the same activity â€“ all using Target Standard !

One of the objectives of this lab is to get you familiar with the APIs that work behind the scenes as you interact with the Target UI. The API provides the flexibility to integrate Adobe Target with custom applications. This lab provides you hands on experience with some of the APIs and gives you a glimpse of whats possible.
